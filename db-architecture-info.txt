ERD - Entity Relation Diagram

a role can have many permissions
a permission can belong to many roles
therefore its many to many - so we can have a roles_permissions table


a user may have one role 
but a role can belong to many roles
therefore user-role => one to many

a blogpost can have only one author
but a user can have many blogposts
therefore blogpost-user => one to many

a comment can belong to one blogpost
but a blogpost can have many comments
therefore comment-blogpost => one to many
