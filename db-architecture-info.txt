ERD - Entity Relation Diagram

a role can have many permissions
a permission can belong to many roles
therefore its many to many - so we can have a roles_permissions table


a user may have one role 
but a role can belong to many roles
therefore user-role => one to many

a blogpost can have only one author
but a user can have many blogposts
therefore blogpost-user => one to many

a comment can belong to one blogpost
but a blogpost can have many comments
therefore comment-blogpost => one to many

a like can belong to one blogpost
but a blogpost can have many likes
so blogpost-like => one to many



# things to revise
 1) Third Normal forms
 2) Entity Relationship Diagram
 3) Database cardinality
 4) Advanced Database

# Installed mysql workbench, shell
    # added to windows path
    # tested using cmd
    # created a database 
    ## ran "node ./database/actions/db-connect.js" command and it is connecting to the mysql database

    ### Need to refresh mysql fundamentals and concepts a bit before moving on
